# Analysis of Stock Data Using Excel VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
We helped Steve in the previous modules and now he wants to expand the data and do an analysis using Excel VBA to find out useful information regarding to the stock data. Although the code we generated previously works for other data, it might not work for thousands of stocks. Therefore, we need to refactor the code to let the VBA script run faster.\
In this process, we want to loop through the data one time using the data we collected in the previous modules. We need to use VBA to refactor the code we need to determine the positive and negative returns of stocks in 2017 and 2018. 
## Result
From our results, negative returns in 2018 were higher than in 2017.  That's not enough to generate positive returns for 2018. Tickers ENPH and RUN should have been seen as good investments due to positive returns in 2018. 

The execution time for 2017 is  0.047s, while for 2018 is 0.039s, which are faster than the original script.

## Summary
## Advantages and Disadvantages for Refactoring Code
The advantage for refactoring code is that we can access the data we want in a faster time. The disadvantages might be refactoring code is very time consuming.
## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
We need to make sure that the code we produced in the end is clear and there is no mistake in any of the steps, because a single mistake might cause the entire code unable to run. Also, if the project we need to finish is in a tight time frame, we might also need to reconsider using VBA because it is a bit time consuming.
